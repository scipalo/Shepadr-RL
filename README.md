# Shepadr-RL

Assignment for subject Artificial inteligence (reinforcement learning)

After you have installed your package with pip install -e gym-shepherd, 
you can create an instance of the environment with gym.make('gym_shepherd:shepherd-v0')

How to use environment:

import gym
import gym_shepherd
env = gym.make('Shepherd-v0')

Due to the fast approaching deadline for school asignment the code has some unoptimised and confusing lines added in the end.
Thank you for understanding :)
